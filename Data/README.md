# Liquid Liquid Photoelectric Sensor Dataset


This is a dataset generated by using the photoelectric sensor setup depicted in the poster "Photoelectric sensor setup and characterization for general interface detection in laboratory scale liquid-liquid extraction processes".

Each folder contains a metadata.json file detailing the liquids composition, volumes, and other relevant conditions, as well as a collection of samples.

Each sample folder contains a .csv file with the data captured by the different channels in the photoelectric sensor ([Sparkfun Triad Spectroscopy](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/8/5/f/0/3/AS7265x_Design_Considerations.pdf)) and a conductivity sensor connected to the end of the funnel. The separated liquids are drained with a dosing pump at a rate of approximately 1ml per step.

Each folder contains also images at each draining step, taken with a webcam (Logitech C525) from a location specified in the metadata file.
